                  <div class="faq-item">
                  <h5>Is Interloop a CRM? Or do we need a CRM as well?</h5>
                  <p><b>EITHER OR.</b> This depends on the needs of your organization.  We focus on the sales execution piece of "CRM", essentially enabling reps to perform at their best.</p>

                  <p>We have basic CRM functionality included in interloop but you can also use Interloop together with your current CRM, such as Salesforce or Sugar CRM.</p>

                  <p>That said, many customers do replace their old CRM with Interloop's built-in CRM capabilities.</p>

                  <div class="faq-item">
                  <h5>What is IBM Watson & why is it so different?</h5>
                  <p><b>IBM Watson</b> is a technology platform that uses natural language processing and machine learning to reveal insights from large amounts of unstructured data.  We believe it is the next big step in computing and will revolutionize the approach to business software.</p>

                  <h5>Do we have to buy onboarding services?</h5>
                  <p><b>YES.</b> While Interloop is incredibly easy to setup and customize, we want to ensure that you quickly become familiar with the tools to execute your sales strategy. We want to become your sales execution partner and we've seen that proper onboarding is key to overall success.</p>
                  <p>
                  We also provide data import services to safely bring your data from your current database or other sources as well as sales process design sessions to map your unique sales process and strategy into Interloop</p>

                  <p><b>No.</b> While many other software companies provide self-service trials of their software (and often self-service support as well), we don't believe it to be the most efficient way for you to reach your sales goals.</p>

                  <p>Instead, we'll take the time to understand how we can help you execute your sales strategy. From there, we can give you a pilot of the software to ensure it matches your needs. Just <a href="/get-started">contact us</a> and we'll get started.</p>
