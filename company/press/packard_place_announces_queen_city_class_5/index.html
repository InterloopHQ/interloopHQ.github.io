					<p>The Program Leadership Team, including representatives from all key sponsors, believe strongly in Charlotte as a hub for innovation for the financial sector and is using QC FinTech to help reach this goal. This year, the QC FinTech companies and local business executives will be meeting with the mayor of Charlotte to discuss and build out the Charlotte FinTech initiative, designed to promote the city as a hub for FinTech innovation and excellence. For the past 2 and a half years, Roselli has partnered with a team of North Highland consultants, and community Financial Services leaders to make this vision a reality.</p>

					<p>This year, BB&T, Synchrony Financial, American Airlines and Ally Bank joined sponsors from years past in supporting the QC FinTech program. Their sponsorship is essential to the growth of the program and the goal of raising Charlotte’s national and international profile as a Fintech innovation hub.</p>

					<p>North Highland, a global consulting firm with expertise in both innovation and financial services, is a QC FinTech strategic partner. Since October 2014, North Highland consultants have been engaged to create the curriculum, manage the overall program and serve as mentors to the participants. Jeff McMahon, the Charlotte Office Lead and Managing Director of North Highland, says “We are committed to the Charlotte startup community. QC FinTech is an ideal way for North Highland to give back to this great city and ensure Charlotte remains a key player in the technology and financial innovation sector.”</p>

					<p>In November 2014 Wells Fargo became a marquee sponsor of the QC FinTech program. David Carroll, who leads Wells Fargo’s Wealth, Brokerage, and Retirement group, noted that the company’s commitment to QC FinTech is a natural fit. “Wells Fargo has a culture of innovation that benefits both our customers and our team members,” Carroll said. “We are excited to support a venture that will foster innovation and provide an environment where small businesses can thrive.”</p>

					<p>In January 2015, Extended Stay America committed to sponsor the program by providing rooms to out of town participants for the full 12-week program. Extended Stay America’s commitment to provide housing for the Queen City FinTech class of entrepreneurs, who are traveling from across the country and internationally, allows them to experience all that the Charlotte community has to offer, while focusing their capital on building their business versus living expenses. It’s a tremendous competitive advantage for our QC FinTech program as we recruit companies to Charlotte.” Jonathan Halkyard, chief financial officer of
					Extended Stay America adds, “Business travelers are very important to us; they account for nearly half of our annual guests. We are proud to be able to sponsor Queen City FinTech and the emerging businesses they support.”</p>
